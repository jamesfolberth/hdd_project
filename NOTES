We do not want to put data files in the repo.  We'll have to each make data directories (possibly subdirectories of the repo) that are ignored by git.

The csv files that contains the list of all the songs, along with the genres, has incorrect file extensions for the songs (uses .mp3 instead of .wav).

If you want to listen to any of these groovy tracks, use audioplayer.  For example
   player = audioplayer(wav, fs);
   play(player)
   pause(player)
   stop(player)

I believe there exist methods for computing two real FFTs for O(N\log N) + O(N) recovery work (i.e. cheaper than two O(N\log N) separate FFTs).  We'll have to profile both implementations.

As of 18 Oct 2014, the FFT call in melFeatures.m is roughly half of the total cost of running melFeatures.m
